The ever evolving OT and IoT worlds continuously faces us with new challenges. One of this challenges is the ability inside a network of correctly identify a device without using the "standard" identifiers provided by the device itself. In this work we proposed a Neural Network classifier model able to solve the identification task with great accuracy. The identification is performed using information extrapolated from the traffic data from/to the device itself inside the network. The proposed model is tested using two different datasets: an industrial dataset and the IoT Sentinel dataset. In both cases the model is able to reach an  high prediction accuracy. The trained models are further tested in the classification of devices not included in the training dataset showing the capability of the proposed model of correctly classifying them.
